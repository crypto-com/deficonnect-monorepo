# Supported Environments

DeFi Wallet SDK lets you connect your dapps to DeFi Wallet in the following ways:

- Desktop web: Automatically connects to Wallet extension or displays a QR code for users to connect with the Wallet mobile app.

- Mobile browser: Wallet SDK generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your dapp in the Wallet mobile dapp browser.

- Dapp browser in Wallet: Wallet SDK recognizes and connects to the injected web3 provider in Wallet's mobile dapp browser with no need for extra approvals.
